# CS1430 Final Project - Parrotfish

# Team Members
- Rayhan Meghji
- Matthew McQuistion

# Description
Our project combines audio source separation targeting timbral differences with visual speaker identification, where both methods employ the Discrete Wavelet Transform.

# Usage
Our model can be used on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://rmeghji-parrotfish.hf.space/) to process video and audio files either separately or together, or locally with:
- `python src/main.py` for audio
- `python src/vision/main_vision.py` for video.
